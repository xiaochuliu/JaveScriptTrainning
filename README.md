Promises
Promises are a very powerful abstraction on top of callbacks and many asynchronous libraries are starting to use them by default. They are included as a language standard in ES6, and with future versions building them up even further, now is a great time to learn.

This sprint is designed to ease you into using implementing and consuming promises by comparing them to the callback pattern you are already familiar with.

Setup

  1│npm install
Bare Minimum Requirements

Review the Node style callback pattern

Asynchronous functions in JavaScript should follow the node style callback pattern. There are two conditions for this pattern:

The function expects a callback as the last argument
The callback is invoked with (err, results)
Here's an example of consuming Node's built-in fs.readFile. Notice that the callback we pass into it meets the two conditions above:

  1│
  2│
  3│
  4│
  5│
  6│
  7│
  8│fs.readFile(__dirname + '/README.md', 'utf8', function (err, content) {
  console.log('Example from callbackReview.js')
  if (err) {
    console.log('fs.readFile failed :(\n', err)
  } else {
    console.log('fs.readFile successfully completed :)\n', content)
  }
});

Use the Promise constructor

There are five steps to writing a promise-returning function:

Create a promise with the new Promise constructor
Do something async, then...
Pass the successful value into the resolve function
this value will be made available in the next then block
only 1 value can ever be passed into resolve
Pass any errors into the reject function
this error will be made available in the catch block
return the promise instance. This should be a synchronous step

Promisify existing functions

There's an easier way to create a promise returning version of a function that exactly follows the node style callback pattern used previously. This technique is called promisification, and implemented different in each library

All of the work done in promiseConstructor.js can be done in these three lines:

  1│
  2│
  3│var nodeStyle = require('./callbackReview.js');
var pluckFirstLineFromFileAsync = Promise.promisify(nodeStyle.pluckFirstLineFromFile)
var getStatusCodeAsync = Promise.promisify(nodeStyle.getStatusCode)
Assuming all functions in a library precisely follow the node style callback pattern, you can even promisify an entire library!

  1│
  2│
  3│Promise.promisifyAll(fs);
// Promisifies all 'fs' functions and gives us an `Async` suffixed version
// For example - `fs.readFileAsync`, `fs.writeFileAsync`

  // (1) See if the user already exists
  db.findUserInDatabase(user, function(err, existingUser) {
    if (err) {
      callback(err, null)
    } else if (existingUser) {
      callback('User already exists!', null)
    } else {
      // (2) then, secure the user by hashing the pw
      db.hashPassword(user, function(err, securedUser) {
        if (err) {
          callback(err, null)
        } else {
          // (3) then, create and save the new secured user
          db.createAndSaveUser(securedUser, function(err, savedUser) {
            if (err) {
              callback(err, null)
            } else {
              // (4) We're finally done! Pass our new saved user along
              callback(null, savedUser)
            }
          });
        }
      });

  });
};

    .then(function(existingUser) {
      if (existingUser) {
        throw new Error('User already exists!') // Head straight to `catch`. Do not pass Go, do not collect $200
      } else {
        return user; // Return a synchronous value
      }
    })
    .then(function(newUser) {
      return db.hashPasswordAsync(newUser) // Return a promise
    })
    .then(function(securedUser) {
      return db.createAndSaveUserAsync(securedUser) // Return another promise
    })

Handle asynchronous collections with Promise.all

A common asynchronous pattern:

Run a few async tasks (read some files, send API requests, etc.)
Collect or transform the data (parse data file, filter API response, etc.)
Run a new async task based on the collected data (more API requests, write to file/db, etc.)
The challenge becomes ensuring that all tasks in step 1 have completed before moving onto step 2. Promise.all solves this problem with grace.
